# Definition
* **Repository:**
    *It's a collection of commits, branches and tags to identify commits. A repository contains all of your project files and each file's revision history.*

* **Clone:** 
    *Cloning is creating a local copy of the repository in your computer. We can make changes locally and push it to the main repository.*
  
* **Fork:**
    *Instead of using a single server-side repository to act as the “central” codebase, forking gives every developer a server-side repository. This means that each contributor has not one, but two Git repositories: a private local one and a public server-side one.*
  
* **Branch:**
    *A branch represents an independent line of development.The most recent commit on a branch is referred to as the tip of that branch. The tip of the branch is referenced by a branch head, which moves forward as additional development is done on the branch.It is like a pointer to a commit.*
