* **Repository:**
    *It's a collection of commits, branches and tags to identify commits. A repository contains all of your project files and each file's revision history.*

* **Clone:** 
    *Cloning is creating a local copy of the repository in your computer. We can make changes locally and push it to the main repository.*
  
* **Fork:**
    *Instead of using a single server-side repository to act as the “central” codebase, forking gives every developer a server-side repository. This means that each contributor has not one, but two Git repositories: a private local one and a public server-side one.*
