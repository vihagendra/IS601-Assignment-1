* **Repository:**
    *It's a collection of commits, branches and tags to identify commits. A repository contains all of your project files and each file's revision history.*

* **Clone:** 
    *Cloning is creating a local copy of the repository in your computer. We can make changes locally and push it to the main repository.*
  
* **Fork:**
    *Instead of using a single server-side repository to act as the “central” codebase, forking gives every developer a server-side repository. This means that each contributor has not one, but two Git repositories: a private local one and a public server-side one.*
  
* **Branch:**
    *A branch represents an independent line of development.The most recent commit on a branch is referred to as the tip of that branch. The tip of the branch is referenced by a branch head, which moves forward as additional development is done on the branch.It is like a pointer to a commit.*
  
* **Commit:**
    *It stores the current contents of the index in a new commit along with a log message from the user describing the changes*
  
* **Merge:**
    *To bring the contents of another branch into the current branch. In the case where the merged-in branch is from a different repository, this is done by first fetching the remote branch and then merging the result into the current branch. In simple words, it is joining two or more commit histories.*
