* **Repository:**
    *It's a collection of commits, branches and tags to identify commits. A repository contains all of your project files and each file's revision history.*

* **Clone:** 
    *Cloning is creating a local copy of the repository in your computer. We can make changes locally and push it to the main repository.*
